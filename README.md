This work proposes a fuzzy logic–based collision estimator for autonomous vehicles in a changing dynamic driving scenario, where two vehicles execute lane-change maneuvers simultaneously. This work has been published in the ACM Journal on Autonomous Transportation Systems, titled “Dynamic Planning of Optimally Safe Lane-change Trajectory for Autonomous Driving on Multi-lane Highways Using a Fuzzy Logic–based Collision Estimator.”
